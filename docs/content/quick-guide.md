###### The Print Function

A Classic "Hello, World" Program

```python
print("Hello, World!");
```

Koi has a `print` and a `println` function built in to the standard library.

```java
println("Hello, World!");
```

###### Variables and Assignment

Variables are declared with the `var` keyword.

```js
var name = "fishy face";
```

Once a variable is declared it can be re-assigned to any value of any type.

```js
name = "Fishy";
```
